Changes and Explanations:
aptos_coin::AptosCoin Module:

Added the correct import for AptosCoin, used for the prize distribution in distribute_prize. This ensures the contract interacts with Aptos' native token.
Key Structural Fixes:

has key was used in the structs since LotteryState and LotteryTicket need to be stored on-chain, tied to an account’s address.
Random Number Generation:

The draw_winner function uses the account address as part of the random number generation. While not fully secure, this simulates randomness for learning purposes. For a real-world system, this could be enhanced using more secure random sources, like an oracle.
Correct Use of Option Types:

The code uses the option::some and option::none to represent the presence or absence of a winning ticket.
Distribute Prize:

The distribute_prize function ensures that if a winner has been selected, they receive all the AptosCoin in the contract owner’s account.
